I tried it with no luck.
I commented out the images Loop.
Additionally , I added drawing different Colors and Sizes of Rectangles every 3 seconds on the Screen.
But, all I can get is a Blank White screen.

Fixed Color codes to 3-bytes RGB , not 2-bytes code, also Color Codes Inverted (255 - Byt).

Busy working on Fixing it.

Original code only gives you a White screen.

2nd modified version only draws in Gray (with Black and White) shades.

Bad / wrong color coding format being sent to the LCD.
